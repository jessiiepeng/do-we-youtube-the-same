# Do we youtube the same?

It's 3am and you have work the next day. You shut off your phone and proceed to close your eyes. Just as you begin to doze off, a stray thought enters your mind:
- How do you lay peacock eggs?
- Do Oreo fries exist and if so, what do they taste like?
- What should I make for lunch tomorrow?
- Did my favourite kpop band release a MV?
You groan and pull out your phone, opening Youtube. Guess who spends another hour watching videos?

I am addicted to youtube. My friends are addicted to youtube. Let's all spend more time on youtube by exploring what channels we spend our time on, instead of sleeping!
